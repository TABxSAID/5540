# A - Gender Differences in Math and Reading Scores

Boxplots show that males slightly outperform females in math (median 69 vs. 64), while females lead in reading (73 vs. 65). Score spread is similar in math, but females have more consistent reading scores. Some female math outliers suggest room for support. These trends hint at subject-based strengths, possibly influenced by interests or teaching styles.

# B - Impact of Test Preparation on Math Scores

Students who completed test prep score higher in math (median 70 vs. 64). Their scores are also more consistent. Violin plots show a denser high-score cluster. With 36% completing prep, the benefit is clear. Prep seems to help, though motivation might also play a role.

# C - Lunch Type and Average Performance

Students with standard lunch average 71 overall, compared to 60 for those on free/reduced lunch. This 11-point gap suggests a link between nutrition (or socioeconomic status) and performance. The trend holds across subjects. Support programs could help narrow the gap.

# D - Correlations Among Subject Scores

Reading and writing are highly correlated (0.95), with math also showing strong links (0.82 with reading, 0.80 with writing). High scores tend to cluster together. This suggests students strong in one area often do well in others, though math stands out as slightly more distinct.

# E - Math vs Reading Association by Test Prep

Math and reading scores are strongly correlated (0.82) regardless of prep status. But prep students score higher overall. The trend lines are parallel, meaning prep boosts scores without changing the overall relationship between subjects.
